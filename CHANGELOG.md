# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are logged here, newest first. Versions
follow [semver](https://semver.org/) loosely: MAJOR for breaking rule/UI
changes, MINOR for new features or AI behavior changes, PATCH for small
fixes/tweaks. The version shown in the app (bottom of the top info strip)
corresponds to the entries below.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-24
- Fixed the contract strip wrapping onto two lines at the new font size:
  dropped "Hand N" from it (moved into the Scores modal instead) and moved
  the version badge up into the header row, centered between the
  SHEEPSHEAD title and the Trump/Scores buttons. The play-area header is
  now just "Dealer: X · Y picked · Called: A#" (plus "· Alone" when it
  applies), full width, one line. (`8a240a6`)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-24
- Added a "Last Trick" feature: the tricks/score text in the bottom-right of
  the hand area is now a button (styled like "Scores") that opens a modal
  listing the previous trick's cards by player, in the order they were
  played (leader first), with "led"/"won" tags and points taken. (`9c442a7`)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-24
- Bumped font sizes ~20% across the board (card ranks/suits, seat labels,
  status text, modals, buttons) for readability — feedback flagged clubs
  and spades as hard to tell apart at the old sizes. Card dimensions and
  the overall layout footprint are unchanged; a little padding was trimmed
  in the header/status areas to offset the larger text so the table area
  doesn't get cramped. (`7464f12`)
- Simplified the version badge to just `vX.Y.Z` (dropped the trailing
  commit-hash suffix, which had hex letters in it). Removed the now-unused
  git-hash injection from `vite.config.js`. (`7464f12`)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-24
- Fixed the leftmost card getting clipped off-screen during the bury phase
  (8 cards held) on narrower phones — confirmed via a real Pixel 9
  screenshot. The hand fan now shrinks ~10% (card size + overlap) whenever
  more than 6 cards are held; normal 6-card play is unaffected. (`83ac79f`)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-24
- Added a discreet version/commit badge to the UI (`v0.4.0·6b7ef41` style) so
  tester screenshots carry an exact build stamp. (`6b7ef41`)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-24
- Lengthened the post-trick pause from 1.5s to 2.625s (+75%) so there's more
  time to read the completed trick before it clears. (`5a34fe6`)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-24
AI overhaul — six targeted improvements, each tuned and verified against a
new headless simulation harness (`npm run simulate`) before shipping:
- Extracted game logic into `src/engine.js` and added
  `scripts/simulate.mjs`, which plays thousands of all-AI hands and reports
  pick rate, picker win rate, alone rate, schneider/no-tricker rate, and
  average points — the regression check used for everything below.
  (`02325bb`)
- Card-counting: track every played card so the AI can reason about what's
  still unaccounted for. (`3b4710e`)
- Trump-aware leading: run a suit safely when holding all remaining trump,
  press when opponents are nearly out of trump, instead of a fixed
  "3+ trumps or a queen" rule. (`27d1fae`)
- Defenders now lead a short called-suit holding to flush out the picker's
  partner early, instead of only passively avoiding that suit. (`1f72ed1`)
- Loosened schmear conditions so points get fed to a winning teammate more
  often instead of only on the literal last card of a trick. (`d5becab`)
- Exact minimax solve for the last two tricks, where the remaining game
  tree is small enough to brute-force optimal play instead of leaning on
  heuristics right when hands are usually decided. (`f056950`)
- Deliberate "go alone" for exceptional hands (handStrength >= 17), tuned
  empirically: alone rate rose from ~25% to ~30% at equal or better
  win rate/EV per hand (confirmed at n=20,000 simulated hands). (`68d3361`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24
- Fixed mobile layout: the app now locks to the real viewport height
  (`100dvh`, overflow hidden) instead of `min-height: 100vh`, so the hand no
  longer requires scrolling to see on phones. Added safe-area padding for
  notched devices. (`b79b9ea`)
- Ignored stray Vite temp config files. (`f9c9a4c`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-24
- Initial version: Sheepshead (5-handed, call-an-ace variant) built with
  React + Vite, playable against four AI opponents. (`6d1a60d`)
